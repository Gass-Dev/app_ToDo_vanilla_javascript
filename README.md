# app_ToDo_vanilla_javascript


By using vanilla javascript (without external librairies such as React, vue, ...), build a todo app allowing a user to:

- Display tasks
- Create a task
- Edit a task
- Mark a task as done
- Delete a task
- User can see when a task is created, and a task is done

No backend required, custom css
